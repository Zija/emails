## Working with the Repo

### Special Ignore Patterns

In addition to ignoring directories and files explicitly in **.gitignore** this repo has two special naming conventions for ignoring old or temporary files.

1. **`*.old`**   
   To delete a file or directory from the repo without deleting the files from your computer, just add ".old" to the very end of the name. Items renamed this way will be deleted from the repo (a change which should be committed as its own commit).
1. **`.ignore/`**   
   _For temporary use only_ (except at the repo's root level). Any directory named ".ignore" will be ignored by default. ".ignore" folders can be used as _temporary_ folders for holding files for quick reference.
